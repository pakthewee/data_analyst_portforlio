## About
Hello, I'm Pakthewee and you call me Jah or Pak as you prefer:) 

I have an analytics background in insurance, banking, and telecommunications, where I worked on projects involving marketing & campaign segmentation, data quality troubleshooting, and identifying/fixing error patterns.
I enjoy solving problems through data, especially when extracting, cleaning, and analyzing complex datasets to uncover actionable insights.

I have worked on projects involving:

- Marketing & campaign segmentation to optimize customer targeting strategies

- Lead generation or report automation pipeline

- Data quality analysis to identify and resolve error patterns in large-scale datasets

- Business intelligence reporting to support decision-making across cross-functional teams

I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights and enjoy solving complex problems through analytical thinking, statistical modeling, and programming.

Currently, I’m preparing to begin my MSc in Financial Mathematics at one of the university in UK, where I will focus on risk management, discrete-time finance, and continuous-time finance. My goal is to bridge my strong analytics background with advanced quantitative finance skills.


## What I’m working on
- Building data analysis & modeling projects in Python and SQL to showcase problem-solving skills
